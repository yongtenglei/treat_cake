def handle_condition_a():
    # ### Situation 1:
    # If Agent 4 weakly prefers some piece t ∉ {k, k′}, then the current division is envy-free: assign piece t to Agent
    # 4, piece k′ to Agent 2, piece k to Agent 3, and the remaining piece to Agent 1.

    # ### Situation 2:
    # If Agent 4 weakly prefers piece k′, then the current division satisfies Condition B on trail γ^{B}_{2,k,k′}.
    # In particular, each of the pieces k and k′ is (weakly) preferred by at least two of Agents 2, 3, and 4.
    # Thus, we can switch to following trail γ^{B}_{2,k,k′}.

    # ### Situation 3:
    # If Agent 4 strictly prefers piece k at the current division, then she will still prefer it if we continue on the
    # trail γA k . However, since Condition A does not hold if we stay on that trail, it must be that Agent 3 no longer
    # weakly prefers piece k if we stay on the trail. As a result, after swapping the roles of Agent 3 and Agent 4 in
    # the argument, we again find ourselves in one of two previous cases.
